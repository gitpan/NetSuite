TODO: 

When doing a search where no search value should be defined,
a blank value is being inserted causing the query to fail.
The bad query and the corrected query are below.  The module
should be updated to not force a searchValue is the value
field in the hash reference doesn't exist.

# BAD (should work)
my $query = {
    basic => [
        { name => 'customFieldList', value => [
                {
                    name => 'customField',
                    attr => {
                          operator => 'notEmpty',
                        internalId => 'custentity30',
                        'xsi:type' => 'core:SearchStringCustomField'
                    },
                },
            ],
        },
    ],
};

# GOOD (shouldn't have to do this)
my $query = {
    basic => [
        { name => 'customFieldList', value => [
                {
                    name => 'customField',
                    attr => {
                          operator => 'contains',
                        internalId => 'custentity30',
                        'xsi:type' => 'core:SearchStringCustomField'
                    },
                    value => '@'
                },
            ],
        },
    ],
};

1.03 - Mon Aug 18 21:09:08 2008
Updated the NetSuite module to officially support version 2008.1.
Made modifications to the _parseResponse routine to correct a bug 
(thanks Eric Rybski). Uncommented a piece of logic to validate a 
correct search type.  Updated the Config.pl - a script to generate 
a new Config.pm from the current NetSuite WSDL file.  It now has 
documentation, debugging, and could be released with the final product.
Allowed the module to run any version of SOAP::Lite.

1.02 - Mon Jun 30 12:34:00 2008
Quickly upated the Config.pl to pull from the new NetSuite WSDL
file.  Produced a new Config.pm and updated the NetSuite module
to pull from the new endpoint.

It passed the test suite, but didn't do any thorough testing.

1.01 - Tue Feb 19 09:19:39 2008 
Adjusted the logic in the _parseNode routine
to correct an issue with parsing custom fields.
If there was a customField whos value was an 
internalId it was not returning it.
TODO: Allow the TYPE of custom field to also
be returned in the result set.

1.00 - Tue Feb  5 21:10:45 2008
Inital module is complete.  Built in support for
checking module dependencies in the Makefile.pl and
required debugging modules at compile-time, 
bsaed on directives passed into the constructor
(i.e., DEBUG => 1) will now check for the existance
of XML::Parser::PerlSAX and XML::Handler::YAWriter
and croak if they are unavailable.
