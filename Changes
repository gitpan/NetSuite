1.00 - Tue Feb  5 21:10:45 2008
Inital module is complete.  Built in support for
checking module dependencies in the Makefile.pl and
required debugging modules at compile-time, 
bsaed on directives passed into the constructor
(i.e., DEBUG => 1) will now check for the existance
of XML::Parser::PerlSAX and XML::Handler::YAWriter
and croak if they are unavailable.
